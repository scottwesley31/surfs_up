## Overview of the Analysis
Following a much-needed vacation to Hawaii, my theoretical self decided to start the process of opening a "Surf n' Shake" shop in Oahu which will provide customers with surfing gear and also ice cream. With some money in the bank to invest into this business idea, I contacted W. Avy an investor willing to support the business plan. W. Avy requests an analysis of the weather in Oahu to ensure that this business would be sustainable.

An in-depth analysis of the precipitation levels, min and max temperatures, and an average temperature that occurs at multiple stations in Oahu was completed initially. This information was made vailable on a web browser (using Flask). W. Avy now would like to gather more information about temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu.
